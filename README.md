# Assessing_Predictive_Capaibility_Of_CL_Metrics_Using_Model_Based_Virtual_Patient_Simulations
The repository contains the code to sample the virtual patients from a pre-trained dataset and use them in conjuction with a physics-based mathematical model to predict a given closed-loop controller performance metrics of an unknown dataset
